This is a set of scripts that allows you to use an Amazon [Kindle][]
as a weather display device.  This was inspired by [Matthew Petroff's
work][mpetroff], but I have rewritten just about everything for this
project.

This will initially display summary forecasts for the current day and
the next day, as well as temperature and probability of precipitation
graphs for the next 12 hours:

If you press the main button on the Kindle, you will get summary
forecasts for the subsequent four days:
